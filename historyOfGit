History of Git

Git has its roots in the development environment for the Linux kernel. 

In the early 2000s, the team working on the kernel began using a proprietary distributed source control system called BitKeeper (BK). The team was allowed to use this system for free. 
Over time, differences of opinion developed around the use of BK to the point that the owner of that system revoked free use of the product.
At that time, 2005, Linus Torvalds, the  creator of Linux, set out to create a new system that maintained the distributed ideal, 
and incorporated additional concepts he had been working with. 

He wanted it to provide the fast performance that a project on the scope of the Linux kernel would need. 
This was the motivation and idea that lay behind the creation of Git came into being. 
Development began in early April of 2005, and an initial release was ready by July. 
Originally, there was an idea of purposing Git as a toolkit that could have other systems implemented on top of it. 
However, over time, it has been made into a full-fledged SCM in its own right. 
If youâ€™re wondering about the name, there are multiple definitions for the word Git, but all of them imply a negative connotation about a person. 
Git was given its name by its creator. Linus jokingly stated that he named all his projects after himself.
